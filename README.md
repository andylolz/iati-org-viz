# IATI Org File Visualiser

Visualise IATI org files from the comfort of your own browser.

## Development

You’ll need recent versions of `npm`, `node` and `gulp-cli`.

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm run watch
```

Then in Chrome, visit chrome://extensions and enable developer mode. Then click “Load unpacked” and load the generated `dist` folder.
